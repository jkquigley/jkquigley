Hi, Iâ€™m Keane Quigley. 

I'm originally from South Africa and have a degree in Mathematics (BSc Hons) from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. Currently, I'm studying towards a Master's Degree in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford, England!

I enjoy finding unique and interesting ways to apply the concepts I learn in my degree. This is why I was a dedicated senior member and subteam lead at Edinburgh University Formula Student where I helped develop an autonomous racecar! The team competes annually in Formula Student UK at Silverstone Race Circuit and has won the FSUK-AI category six years running. Since starting my course in Oxford, I have joined Oxford University Racing and hope to build up a team for the autonomous competition here.

Most of my programming experience is in C++, Python, C# and MATLAB/Simulink. This includes libraries and tools such as OpenCV, Robot Operating System, NumPy, SymPy and SciPy. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to play around with Velodyne and Ouster LiDARs, LeddarTech LiDARs, Stereolabs ZED cameras, and Speedgoat Real-Time Tagret Machines. In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos.

My intersets in mathematics lie mostly within computational mathematics and numerical analysis. I spent much of my final year at Edinburgh working on a group project titled _Numerical Methods for Solving the Advection Equation_. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/kquigley29/numerate). Currently, I am working on my master's dissertation titled _Multilevel Radial Basis Function Approximation of PDEs_. The work-in-progress can be found [here](https://github.com/kquigley29/radiant).Alongside these projects, I have taken/am taking courses in numerical linear algebra, numerical ordinary and partial differential equations, optimisation, and machine learning. On the other hand, I have enjoyed pure mathematics courses in differential equations, functional analysis, differential geomerty, complex analysis, and number theory.
