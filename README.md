Hi, Iâ€™m Keane Quigley. 

I'm originally from South Africa and am currently studying Mathematics (BSc Hon) at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

I enjoy finding unique and interesting ways to apply the concepts I learn in my degree. This is why I am a dedicated senior member and former perception subteam leader at Edinburgh University Formula Student Driverless where I help develop an autonomous racecar! We compete at Silverstone Race Circuit annually and have won the Formula Student UK competition four years running!

Most of my programming experience is in C++, Python, C# and MATLAB. This includes libraries and tools such as OpenCV, Robot Operating System, numpy, scipy and Simulink. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to play around with Velodyne LiDARs, LeddarTech LiDARs, Stereolabs ZED cameras and Speedgoat real-time tagret machines.

If you would like to get in contact please email me at keaneq@protonmail.com.
