Hi, Iâ€™m Keane Quigley. 

I'm originally from South Africa and have a degree in Mathematics (BSc Hons) from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. Currently, I'm studying towards a Master's Degree in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford, England!

I enjoy finding unique and interesting ways to apply the concepts I learn in my degree. This is why I am a dedicated senior member and subteam lead at Edinburgh University Formula Student where I help develop an autonomous racecar! We compete at Silverstone Race Circuit annually and have won the Formula Student UK competition five years running.

Most of my programming experience is in C++, Python, C# and MATLAB/Simulink. This includes libraries and tools such as OpenCV, Robot Operating System, NumPy, SymPy and SciPy. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to play around with Velodyne and Ouster LiDARs, LeddarTech LiDARs, Stereolabs ZED cameras, and Speedgoat Real-Time Tagret Machines. In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos.

My intersets in mathematics lie mostly within numerical analysis. I spent much of my final year at Edinburgh working on a group project titled _Numerical Methods for Solving the Advection Equation_. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/kquigley29/numerate). Together with this, I have take courses in numerical methods for linear algebra, ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. On the other hand, I have enjoyed pure mathematics courses in differential equations, linear analysis, differential geomerty, and number theory.
