Hi, I’m Keane Quigley. 

I'm originally from South Africa and am currently studying Mathematics (BSc Hons) at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

I enjoy finding unique and interesting ways to apply the concepts I learn in my degree. This is why I am a dedicated senior member and subteam lead at Edinburgh University Formula Student Driverless where I help develop an autonomous racecar! We compete at Silverstone Race Circuit annually and have won the Formula Student UK competition five years running!

Most of my programming experience is in C++, Python, C# and MATLAB/Simulink. This includes libraries and tools such as OpenCV, Robot Operating System, NumPy, SymPy and SciPy. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to play around with Velodyne and Ouster LiDARs, LeddarTech LiDARs, Stereolabs ZED cameras and Speedgoat real-time tagret machines.

If you would like to get in contact please email me at keaneq@protonmail.com.
