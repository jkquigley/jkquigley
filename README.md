Hi, Iâ€™m Keane Quigley. 

I'm originally from South Africa and am currently studying Mathematics (BSc Hon) at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

I enjoy finding unique and interesting ways to apply the concepts I learn in my degree, particularly in robotics. This is why I am a dedicated member and perception 
subteam leader at Edinburgh University Formula Student AI where I help develop an autonomous racecar! We compete at Silverstone Race Circuit annually and have won the Formula 
Student UK competition four years running.

Most of my programming experience is in C++ and Python. This includes libraries and tools such as OpenCV, Robot Operating System, numpy, scipy, etc. Additionally, I have had
the opportunity to play around with Velodyne LiDARs, LeddarTech LiDARs and Stereolabs ZED cameras and worked as a technician in South Africa where I repaired industrial plumbing 
inspection units.

If you would like to get in contact please email me at keaneq@protonmail.com.
